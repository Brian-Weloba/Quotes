## Description

A simple  Angular app that lets users add their own quotes and vote for their favorite quotes. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

The site was published on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

## Setup

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
